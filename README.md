POMEGRANATE: Cancer Lineage Tree Simulator
============

### About

POMEGRANATE simulates tumor progression from normal tissue producing a branching hierarchy of monoclonal cell populations in accordance with the branched-tree cancer evolution model. Starting with the GL cell population, the simulator iteratively expands the lineage tree by introducing (with some given probability) new daughter cell populations corresponding to newly acquired somatic SNV or CNV events. In particular, in every iteration, each cell population present in the tree can give rise to a new population of cells (with a randomly generated size) representing a new SNV or CNV event, as well as undergo cell death. The user can specify the number of tree growth iterations, as well the probabilities for each event. Each simulated SNV is randomly associated with a genome location (chromosome and position) and haplotype; the CNVs are associated with a chromosome arm and haplotype and currently correspond to a duplication of this chromosome arm. This process results in lineage trees with an arbitrary number of branches and nodes. 

Multiple samples can then be collected from the produced lineage tree(s). Each sample consists of several cell populations (nodes) of the tree, where each such cell population represents a subclone in the sample. The randomized sampling process selects a random subset of nodes from the tree for each sample. Given a selected subset of cell populations, the sample is then created by obtaining a fraction of the cells from each population by sampling from a multinomial distribution with probabilities corresponding to the cell population sizes. 

The program outputs the produced trees, sampled subclones, and the per sample VAFs of each SNV for specified coverage(s), sequencing accuracy, and normal contamination.

Example of a simulated tree with 9 collected tumor samples indicated by different colors; each node represents a cell population that contains every mutation in its lineage; gray indicates dead cell populations.:

### How to Run

From the ```release/``` directory:

```
./pomegranate -dir <output> [options]
```

### Examples

(1) Simulate 50 trees; extract 10 and 15 samples; generate VAFs for coverages of 1,000X and 10,000X; produce the dot files for visualization; output files will be created inside the output_dir directory:
```
./pomegranate -dir output_dir -t 50 -s 10 15 -c 1000 10000 -dot -sdot -v
```

(2) Simulate the default 100 trees; extract 5, 10, and 15 samples; set the normal contamination in each sample to a random value between 10% and 40%:
```
./pomegranate -dir output_dir -s 5 10 15 -minNC 10 -maxNC 40 -dot -sdot -v
```

### Output 

A directory called ```simulation_results/``` will be created inside the output directory specified by the user. Data files associated with each simulated tree will be stored inside in separate directories. For instance, the results for example (1) above are shown below. Here the top simulation directory contains 50 subdirectories for each simulated tree.

Several files are produced for each tree. The ```TREE_plain.txt``` file stores the topology of the tree (as a list of edges and nodes) and the information about each simulated mutation. The ```.dot``` files store the tree in DOT format that can be visualized using Graphviz. The ```TREE_s10.dot``` and ```TREE_s15.dot``` display which cell populations were sampled for the 10 and 15 samples experiments, respectively. To visualize these files, the following command can be used (this will produce a pdf file with the same name):

```dot -Tpdf simulation_results/tree_0/TREE_s10.dot -O```  

The ```VAF```-prefixed files contain the multi-sample variant allele frequency (VAF) information for each sampled SNV. Separate files are generated for the different coverages (e.g. 1,000X and 10,000X). The ```VAF_..._true.txt``` contains the actual VAF of each SNV across the samples. For example, this is a fragment of a file containing SNVs from 15 samples at 1000X coverage:

```
